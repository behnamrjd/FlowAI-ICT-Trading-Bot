### üöÄ Getting Started:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd FlowAI-ICT-Trading-Bot
    ```

2.  **Installation (Using `Install.sh`):**
    The `Install.sh` script attempts to automate the setup of a virtual environment and installation of dependencies.
    ```bash
    bash Install.sh
    ```
    *   Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
    *   The script will create a virtual environment named `flowai_env`.

3.  **Manual Installation (Alternative):**
    *   Create a virtual environment:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv flowai_env
        source flowai_env/bin/activate
        ```
    *   Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        *Note: You might need to install the TA-Lib C library manually before `pip install TA-Lib` can succeed. Refer to TA-Lib documentation for your OS.*

4.  **Configuration:**
    *   Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.
    *   Fill in your API keys and Telegram bot token in the `.env` file:
        *   `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
        *   `BRSAPI_KEY` (from BrsApi.ir)
        *   `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_IDS` (your Telegram user ID)
    *   Review and adjust other parameters in `flow_ai_core/config.py` or via environment variables.

5.  **Running the Bot:**
    *   **Main Trading Bot (with AI and ICT analysis for potential future execution):**
        ```bash
        python main.py
        ```
    *   **Telegram Bot (for signals and interaction):**
        ```bash
        python telegram_bot.py
        ```
    *   **Configuration Wizard (for backtest settings):**
        ```bash
        python config_wizard.py
        ```

*   [ ] Restore or retrain and integrate the primary ML model (`model.pkl`).
*   [ ] Implement full trade execution logic with broker integration.
*   [ ] Enhance risk management module with active position monitoring.
*   [ ] Add more comprehensive automated tests (unit, integration).
*   [ ] Improve documentation and code comments, standardize language to English.
*   [ ] Consider database integration for storing trades, signals, and market data.
