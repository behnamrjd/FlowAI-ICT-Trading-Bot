# This file makes the 'flow_ai_core' directory a Python package.
# It can be empty, or you can use it to make certain modules or functions
# easily accessible when importing the package.

# For example, you could do:
# from .config import SYMBOL, TIMEFRAME # etc.
# from .utils import logger

# For now, let'has_key_ft keep it simple and allow direct imports like:
# from flow_ai_core.config import SYMBOL
# from flow_ai_core.utils import logger

# You can also define a __all__ variable if you want to specify what
# `from flow_ai_core import *` would import, but explicit imports are generally preferred.

# logger = utils.logger # Make logger directly available as flow_ai_core.logger (if utils is imported above)

# No specific code needed here for basic package functionality.
